### Publication
#### Enhancing the performance of COVID-19 case forecasting through mathematical modeling
* Authors: **Jooha Oh**, Caterine Apio, and Taesung Park
* Extended the classical SIR model to the SEIQRDV3P model, incorporating three stages of vaccination as new compartments and accounting for the ratio of delta and omicron variants.

#### Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 based on policy, vaccination, and Omicron data.
* Authors: Kyulhee Han, Bogyeom Lee, Doeun Lee, Gyujin Heo, **Jooha Oh**, Seoyoung Lee, Catherine Apio, and Taesung Park
* Systematically compared various machine learning prediction models and predictor variables to assess their impact on forecasting COVID-19 indicators.
